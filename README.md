# personal-portfolio
A full-stack portfolio 
Learning as I go


I am to build a pet organizer app. A simple app to showcase my skills in frontend and backend.
Welcome to my journey.

First building the backend part ( Java ) - separate repo
Second building the frontend ( Flutter ) - separate repo

After these two. Make sure everything is working and built properly.
Will try to add projects on top of this like a webapp that uses the Java backend or something
