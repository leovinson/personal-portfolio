# personal-portfolio
A full-stack portfolio.
Learning as I go.


I am to build a pet organizer app. A simple app to showcase my skills in frontend and backend.
Welcome to my journey.

First building the backend part ( Java ) - separate repo.
Second building the frontend ( Flutter ) - separate repo.

After these two. Make sure everything is working and built properly.
Will try to add projects on top of this like a webapp that uses the Java backend or something.

- Started planning the Spring Boot backend.
- Rough ideas and overview of how my project works.
- First plan is to first build my foundation. As of today - I am studying, familiarizing and exposing myself to git.
- Currently reviewing java core concepts. -Learning JUnit 5. Will move to hibernate and Spring Core after.
- Will probably delay learning the foundation (Java, SQL, Git, Flutter) for a bit. Planning to learn designing UML Diagrams, flowchart, pseudo-code, etc. for better documentation.
